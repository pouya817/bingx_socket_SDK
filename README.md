That's good for use in thread.
 we've wrapped the WebSocket logic in a WebSocketClient class. The class has the following methods:

__init__(self, subscribe_url, channel_name, product_id): Initializes the class with the necessary parameters.
on_message(self, ws, message), on_error(self, ws, error), on_close(self, ws), and on_open(self, ws): Callback functions for WebSocket events.
start(self): Starts the WebSocket connection and runs it in a separate thread.
stop(self): Closes the WebSocket connection and waits for the thread to finish.
In the if __name__ == "__main__": block, we create an instance of the WebSocketClient class, start the WebSocket connection, and then stop it when needed.

This approach allows you to encapsulate the WebSocket logic in a reusable class and easily start and stop the WebSocket connection as needed.

For use in dgango app Here's an example:

# in your_app/views.py

from .websocket_client import WebSocketClient

class WebSocketManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = WebSocketClient(
            "wss://your_subscribe_url",
            "your_channel_name",
            "your_product_id"
        )
        self.client.start()

    def close_connection(self):
        self.client.stop()

# in your_app/views.py (or any other file where you want to use the WebSocketManager)

from .websocket_manager import WebSocketManager

class MyView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        # Do something in the view
        
        # Close the WebSocket connection
        websocket_manager = WebSocketManager()
        websocket_manager.close_connection()
        
        return render(request, 'your_template.html')
In this example, we've created a WebSocketManager class that initializes and manages the WebSocketClient instance. The WebSocketManager class has a close_connection() method that calls the stop() method of the WebSocketClient instance.

In the MyView class (or any other view where you want to close the WebSocket connection), you can create an instance of the WebSocketManager class and call the close_connection() method when needed.

This way, you can easily manage the WebSocket connection from different parts of your Django app, and close the connection when it's no longer needed
